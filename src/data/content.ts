🌕🌕 DAY 0 🌑🌑

I invite you to embark on a 21-day process of group healing through  
🌗SHADOW WORK🌓 that Krystle in SF put together.

During these 21 days we will think of healing our SHADOW together as a group.
 
What is shadow work?

https://www.centreofexcellence.com/what-is-shadow-work/


On a national and global scale we are currently front and center to old systems and policies that have not been serving the good.better.best collectively for the people - all emphasizing the need for a CHANGE of old ways;
it seems in this time of restructuring systems, it may serve a good opportunity for us to also looking INSIDE ourselves to uncover and unpack old systems and policies within that are no longer useful and not serving what’s best for us.

If we are to think of our shadow as actual and literal WEIGHT that we are carrying around, then you can imagine that by unpacking each aspect that unconsciously plagues us, we become LIGHTER. 
📦🔓💥🕊✨

Shadow work is not exactly easy work; if it was easy, 
everyone would do it.  
Plain and simple.

But keep in mind that this work is not initially about feeling GOOD, but rather about getting GOOD at FEELING.

Also keep in mind, that nearly as soon as we begin to cumulatively confront our shadow, we then have agency over our actions, and
lightness ensues and spills over.✨

What we resist will persist but
THE WAY OUT IS THROUGH ⚡

I am deeply passionate about this work because of the benefits and empowerment showing up in to my life.  
Rather than spend a lifetime of symptomatic, maladaptive behaviors as a result of what’s been unknowingly downloaded beneath, it is immensely possible to live with 
unconditional love 💖

radical acceptance ☯

non-judgement ✨

forgiveness 😌

and unlocking CREATIVITY 🎨
as a side effect of the deeper healing of our shadow.

This 21-day program utilizes daily writing prompts to uncover the dirty-dirt and meditations to help anchor us in awareness and SELF LOVE 💓 
Each day has either one or 2 writing prompts.

I am accessing the help and resources of shadow work and self-healer guru Kelly-Ann Maddox🔮 to put this program together and following the structure of other 21-day programs that are out in the world.

This is Krystles’ first time creating a program of this kind. And my first time leading a group 👁✨👁

Today’s intro is a longer message for obvious reasons however each day will not be as lengthy. 

__

🌓Time Commitment:
	⁃	10-15 minutes for the meditation at a convenient time
	⁃	20-60 minutes to complete the writing prompt of the day

I will send the task + meditation each day for you to complete.

Here are the detailed instructions for the group and our journey together:

🌓Day 0 - RULES OF THE GROUP:

	1.	 After releasing the daily task, you have ONE DAY to complete it.  Once the daily task is released, you have until midnight the following day to complete it. 1⃣🔄

	2.	It is highly recommended that this writing is done by HAND so you will need a notebook for this work. 📖📝

	3.	Before you write, bring yourself to a calm state using whatever tools you may have or the daily meditation.  Be fully focused on the daily task. ✨🏿✨

	4.	If you have questions, please send questions in a PRIVATE MESSAGE to me.  There’s no need to comment “thanks” to the group.  Let’s assume we are thankful. 💯

	5.	If you cannot participate or keep up with the rhythm of the program, _please remove yourself from the group. _ Make this decision on your own.  It’s OK xo.♥️ Honor what you feel and what you need.

it is important for us to maintain the flow so that the energy does not dissipate.

	6.	 After completing the daily task, please write the completion statement: *day 1 done, day 2 done, *etc as asked in the daily task. This is all that will be written to the group.

	7.	Keep the phrase of the day in mind and repeat the daily mantra as often as the need to utilize it happens.


🌓Reminders:

	⁃	If you have questions, comments, concerns, please message me privately

	⁃	There is no pressure in joining or remaining in this group. If this type of work, or timing is not ideal for you, simply make the choice to leave the group.  No stress, no judgement xo.

	⁃	This process is an opportunity to learn how to allocate time for yourself and your development everyday

	⁃	It is deeply recommended that you refrain from using substances of any kind to sedate or control awareness of our shadow as they rise  into consciousness.  The point is to FEEL THE REAL.


🌓Today’s Phrase:

“Starting today, I will be extra gentle and kind to myself as I face the challenge of uncovering my shadows. In order to live light, I must live WHOLE.  I will love myself through it all.”


If you are interested in journeying together and understand and agree to the rules, then please write in the comment:
*“day 0 done” * and 

✨WELCOME to this 21 day adventure!!! 🕊🎢

we will begin the real work tomorrow Tuesday ✨🏻‍♀

      Let there be LIGHT!
 ✨🌑🌚🌘🌗🌔🌕🌝✨

better love,
